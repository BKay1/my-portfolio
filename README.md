My Portfolio - Advanced CSS

Task: To create a portfolio page using both html and css.

Main actions:

1.  Firstly drafted a wireframe;
2.  Following BEM methodology, structured the initial html with anticipated classes recognising that these may have to change subject to the final portfolio page design;
3.  The portfolio comprises three sections: the header with navigation bar, the main section (a picture, about me and how to contact me) and my projects showcasing the projects completed thus far;
4.  The navbar is fully clickable to the appropriate sections;
5.  All stages of the build can be viewed on GitHub which is linked below;
6.  Added media queries and flex boxes for both tablet and mobile views and to ensure each section is responsive;
7.  The projects section references a linked previous project to showcase current skills and additional space for future projects;
8.  Lastly worked on the various css design elements to showcase basic css and design knowledge.
