My Portfolio - Advanced CSS

Task: To create a portfolio page using both html and css.

Main actions:

1.  Firstly drafted a wireframe;
2.  Following BEM methodology structured the initial html with anticipated classes recognising that these may have to change subject to the final portfolio page design;
3.  The design follows three sections: the header with navigation bar, the main section (a picture, about me and how to contact me) and My projects showcasing the projects completed thus far;
4.  The navbar is fully clickable to the appropriate sections;
5.  At each stage of building the portfolio e.g the navbar ensured that i git pushed onto Git Hub;
6.  Added media queries for both tablet and mobile and ensured that each section was responsive;
7.
